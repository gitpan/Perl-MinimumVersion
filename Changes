	- The --blame option now works in the perlver script (ADAMK)

1.23_01 Thu 14 Jan 2010
	- Reworked the internals to capture the version, rule and PPI
	  element responsible for each limitation as P:MV:Reason (ADAMK)
	- Added first experimental version of the new _reason API (ADAMK)
	- Adding 5.8 dependency for "use Carp version ()" (ADAMK)
        - module Errno requires perl 5.5 (Alexandr Ciornii)
        - PPI is no longer compatible with perl 5.5, so P::MV can also
          depend on 5.6 (Alexandr Ciornii)
	- Bumping File::Find::Rule dependency to 0.32 because we break with
	  0.31 (ADAMK)

1.22 Wed  25 Nov 2009
        - Negative length in 'splice' requires perl 5.5 (Alexandr Ciornii)
        - 'mkdir' with one argument requires perl 5.6 (Alexandr Ciornii)
        - 'substr' will not be checked if it is a method name (Alexandr Ciornii)

          Now check for 3-arg open is working.
        - Check 4-arg substr that requires perl 5.5 (Alexandr Ciornii)
        - Postfix foreach requires perl 5.004.05 (Alexandr Ciornii)
        - Scalar::Util::weaken requires perl 5.006 (Alexandr Ciornii)

        - First implementation of _three_argument_open and tests (Alexandr Ciornii)

1.19 Sun 14 Sep 2008
	- Updating PPI and several other dependencies to get a more
	  accurate parse on which to run the analysis.
	- Add a dependency on File::Find::Rule::Perl instead of using
	  a duplicate (worse) copy of the code for it.
