Revision history for Perl module Perl::MinimumVersion

1.36 2014-05-09
    - CHECK block requires 5.6.2
    - UNITCHECK block requires 5.10.0
    - Stacked labels on the same statement requires 5.14.0

1.35 2014-05-02
    - 'state' requires perl 5.10.0, even if you don't also see
      "use feature 'state'", because you can also write "use 5.010" to
      enable 'state'. RT#67626
    - Dropped the rule that said "use base 'Exporter'" should make a
      dependency on Perl 5.008+ RT#89173
    - Improved the fix for RT#95023. Thanks again to Paul Howarth.

1.34 2014-04-24
    - The perlver script wasn't getting installed, because it's in
      a script/ directory. RT#95023, fix from ETHER.
    - t/02_main.t was failing on older versions of perl, because
      a min version is getting reported as '5.01301' on Perl 5.010 and later,
      but as '5.013010' on earlier Perls. RT#95023. I need to understand this
      better, but want to get a passing release out.
