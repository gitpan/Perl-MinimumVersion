NAME
    Perl::MinimumVersion - Find the minimum required Perl version for any
    code

SYNOPSIS
      # Create the checker object
      $object = Perl::MinimumVersion->new( $filename );
      $object = Perl::MinimumVersion->new( \$source );
      $object = Perl::MinimumVersion->new( $Document );
  
      # Find the minimum version
      $version = $object->minimum_version;

DESCRIPTION
    "Perl::MinimumVersion" takes Perl source code and calculates the minimum
    version of perl required to be able to run it. Because it is based on
    PPI, it can do this without having to actually load the code.

    This first release only tests based on the syntax of your code.

    As this module develops, it will also be able to check explicitly
    specified versions via "require 5.005;", and trace module dependencies
    as needed.

    Amoungst other things, we hope to be able to build a test that is able
    to tell when the version needed based on the code syntax is higher than
    the version you explicitly specified (and thus, is a package bug).

    Using "Perl::MinimumVersion" is dead simple, the synopsis pretty much
    covers it.

METHODS
  new $filename | \$source | $PPI_Document
    The "new" constructor creates a new version checking object for a
    PPI::Document. You can also provide the document to be read as a file
    name, or as a "SCALAR" reference containing the code.

    Returns a new "Perl::MinimumVersion" object, or "undef" on error.

  Document
    The "Document" accessor can be used to get the PPI::Document object back
    out of the version checker.

  minimum_version
    The "minimum_version" method is the primary method for finding the
    minimum perl version required based on "all" factors in the document.

    Future versions of this package are expected to also add the methods
    "minimum_syntax_version", "minimum_explicit_version" and
    "minimum_module_version" to handle the three ways in which the version
    dependency can be added.

    Returns a version object, or "undef" on error.

BUGS
    It's very early days, so this probably doesn't catch anywhere near
    enough syntax cases, and I personally don't know enough of them.

    However it is exceedingly easy to add a new syntax check, so if you find
    something this is missing, copy and paste one of the existing 5 line
    checking functions, modify it to find what you want, and report it to
    rt.cpan.org, along with the version needed.

    I don't even need an entire diff... just the function and version.

TO DO
    - Write lots more version checkers

    - Write the explicit version checker

    - Write the recursive module descend stuff
